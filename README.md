web-doc is a framework-agnostic, browser-side document viewer with a TypeScript API and lazily loaded Rust/WASM adapters. It renders modern Office, qualified Word 97–2003 DOC and legacy XLS/PPT, PDF, images, SVG and delimited data without uploading documents to a conversion service.

## About this fork

web-doc is a fork of [Zrimo](https://github.com/bnku/zrimo) (`@zrimo/viewer`), maintained by [@leonidkuznetsov18](https://github.com/leonidkuznetsov18) and released independently under its own name. It carries changes that are proposed upstream but are needed before they land there — currently page-scoped search (`SearchOptions.pageRange`, see the [API reference](docs/api/reference.md)). Everything else, including the upstream documentation, applies unchanged.

- **The package is `web-doc`** on npm; `@zrimo/viewer` on npmjs.com is the upstream package and does not contain this fork's changes. Switching between the two is the dependency name and the import specifier — the runtime API, the CSS hooks (`.zrimo-ui`, `--zrimo-*`, `data-zrimo-*`) and the asset layout are identical.
- **Releases are automatic.** Every merge to `main` produces a semantic version, a changelog entry, a GitHub release with the verified tarball, and an npm publication (see [Commits and releases](CONTRIBUTING.md#commits-and-releases)).

## Supported formats

- DOCX/DOCM, XLSX/XLSM, PPTX/PPTM/PPSX
- Word 97–2003 DOC through the project-owned bounded Word Binary parser and in-memory DOCX serialization
- BIFF8 XLS through bounded in-memory normalization with source-backed styles,
  sheet geometry, merges and safe hyperlinks; PPT through in-memory OOXML
  normalization
- PDF
- PNG, JPEG, WebP, GIF, BMP and multi-page TIFF
- SVG, CSV and TSV

The viewer supports Latin/Cyrillic, CJK, Arabic-script and the agreed Indic scripts through application/system fonts plus lazy self-hosted Noto WOFF2 packs. Macros and document scripts never execute; spreadsheet formulas display stored cached values.

## Install and quick start

```bash
npm install web-doc
npx web-doc-copy-assets public/vendor/zrimo
```

Every [GitHub release](https://github.com/leonidkuznetsov18/web-doc/releases) also attaches the same tarball (`web-doc-x.y.z.tgz`) with `SHA256SUMS` and `pack-report.json`, so a build can be pinned by URL or verified before it is adopted. The second command copies workers, WASM modules and optional font assets into your application's public directory.

```ts
import { ViewerClient } from "web-doc";
import "web-doc/styles.css";

const client = ViewerClient.create({
  assetBaseUrl: new URL("/vendor/zrimo/", location.href),
});
const viewer = client.createViewer({
  container: document.querySelector("#viewer")!,
  ui: true,
  fit: "width",
});

await viewer.load(file, { fileName: file.name });
// Later:
await viewer.destroy();
await client.destroy();
```

Use `web-doc/headless` for UI-free integration and `web-doc/worker` for custom adapter infrastructure. The [getting-started guide](docs/getting-started.md) covers CDN/self-host layouts and MIME requirements.

## Browser and privacy baseline

The target is Safari 16.4+ and the latest two stable Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari versions. Automated lifecycle/fallback scenarios run in Playwright Chromium, Firefox and WebKit; real-browser smoke is mandatory before a stable release.

Documents remain in the browser. There is no telemetry, server conversion or implicit external relationship fetch. Network traffic is limited to an explicit URL source and package/application-owned assets selected by the font and `assetBaseUrl` policies.

## Develop and verify

Prerequisites are Node.js 22.13+ or 24+, npm 11, Rust 1.94.1 with `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, Chromium, and Rust nightly/cargo-fuzz only for the fuzz gate.

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
npm run check
npm run test:qualification
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:e2e:matrix
npm run test:pack
```

Release/security gates additionally include `npm run fuzz:js`, `npm run fuzz:rust`, `npm run audit:vulnerabilities`, `npm run report:size`, and `npm run report:sbom`.

Run either development example from the workspace root:

```bash
npm run dev --workspace @zrimo/example-vanilla
npm run dev --workspace @zrimo/example-react
```

Build and inspect the complete site — landing, documentation and the production
React demo — locally:

```bash
npm run pages:build
npm run pages:preview
# open http://127.0.0.1:4174
```
